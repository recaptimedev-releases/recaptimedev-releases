# Releases CI Bot at Recap Time Squad

My purpose is to automatically publish releases through the GitHub/GitLab APIs for open-source projects the squad has maintained.
While it's advisable not to add this service account to existing orgs and instead add on per-repo basis, you may see me within
[@recaptime-dev](https://github.com/recaptime-dev) repos and on Cachix.

Release GPG keys can be found at TBD.
